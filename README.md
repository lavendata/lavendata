I've googled every SQL function at least 100x. And that’s every analyst's story. Mine is different. 

Starting in Publishing and my love for books, I jumped into Market Research and the world of numbers. I am all about uncovering stories in data and turning reports into something special. More special. And who can do it better than a book lover?

Diving in and out of the bigger chapters in data (and books) helped me grow in my analytical journey. As a Data Analyst, I turned a couple of raw numbers into KPI dashboards, uncovering every story of our users. And what about the ones who hide behind ad blockers in their browsers? I also rocked the ownership of the company’s first-party tracking with Snowplow. Have you seen a canonical event model? I have, it's big, some 120+ properties big.

Tableau & Looker assisted me to build small pieces of the big puzzle, but there are lots of metrics to uncover. Supporting the creation of datamarts, and monitoring metrics, Data is my passion. And now, AI is knocking on the door. What the future holds is for us to discover. And every piece of data has a story to tell.
